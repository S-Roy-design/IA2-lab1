            <p>Hi my name is Sowmma Roy, feel free to call me Roy! Here is what I often look like: <img src="img/sowmma-roy-photo.jpg" alt="A picture of Roy smiling while holding his coffee." class="roy-photo"></p>

            <p>Until high school I grew up in Dhaka, Bangladesh <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1583429891508-015ef9cd958e?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&auto=format&fit=crop&w=356&q=80" alt="A stock photo of traffic in the roads of Dhaka"> following that I came to Richmond, Indiana, United States to pursue a liberal arts education at Earlham College. 
                In parts of my early childhood I would do some drawing and photography during my free times and I enjoyed playing soccer! At Earlham College â€“ I became passionate about <strong class="highlight center-this"> learning, diversity and perspectives.</strong> I supplemented my learning at college by
                partaking in 3 activities:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>serving</strong> as a student resident assistant</li>
                    <li><strong>playing</strong> varsity soccer and cross country</li>
                    <li><strong>interning</strong> in a technology company</li>           
                </ol>
        </section>

            <header><h2 class="section-headers">Life at Earlham</h2></header>
            <p>In taking different classes at Earlham I cultivated an interest to look at scenarios from different lenses. I enjoyed learning about <em>philosophy, Buddhism and cognitive psychology,</em> and I ended up majoring in business management.</p>
            <p class ="underliner center-this capslk-on highlight ">When I interned in my junior year as a Product Manager for the native mobile app, I became introduced to the roles of the departments and the work culture in a tech company. I wanted to get back to that working space and I aspire to come at it from a design perspective.</p>
            <p>Being <strong class="stronger-font">involved</strong> in school as a resident assistant I found an opportunity to help shape the residential experience of first year students. This allowed me to harness my empathy and be strategic with solving student needs through communication, programs, and sharing resources.</p>

            <p>Getting a taste of the tech working space I look forward to being in that space and solve problem creatively. This brought me to decide pursue this path and I coming from the alley of design. I am excited to study interaction design at George Brown School of Design. Here I aim to:</p>
            <ul>
            <li> grow my skills </li>
            <li> enhance my ability to design and</li>
            <li> create intuitive and interactive pieces that users will celebrate using</li>
            </ul>
                <p>I have taken classes in <abbr title="Information Architecture">IA</abbr>, <abbr title="2 dimensional visualization">2D Viz</abbr>, and <abbr title="Visual Design">VD</abbr> and am currently taking IA2, 3D Viz, and <abbr title="Information Design">ID</abbr>.

                <aside><p> I like this quote by Dieter Rams <q class="quote-styler center-this stronger-font" cite="https://hustwit.vhx.tv/">You can not understand good design if you can not understand people</q></p></aside>
                <p>I have started to read and watch documentaries on design. I enjoy watching Gary Hutsuits documentaries; Helvetica and Rams are my favorite.</p>
